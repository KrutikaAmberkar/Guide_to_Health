# Guide_to_Health
' Guide to Health' was created for 'Code For Venezuela' hackathon by Team Paz.

This project was intended to address the general public and the press for basic health care services in Venezuela. 

Our team cleaned and translated the data using python (Juypter Notebook), analyzed, created dashboard for the above specified audience. From our analysis & external research we found that when people are visiting the hospitals, the supplies necessary for their treatment are not available. During emergency, it could be fatal for the patient if there are no supplies. People have no access to data which would help them visit the right hospital according to their preference.
